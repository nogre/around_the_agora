### Potential Titles / Inspiration

Around the Agora 

    Around the Horn, ESPN tv show featuring sports writers arguing over the sports news of the day 
      - Trolley Around the Agora (TAtA)

Whose Trolley is it Anyway? 

    Whose line is it Anyway?, improv comedy show
      - Whose Wisdom is it Anyway?

### Goals

As with the original "Whose Line?", which was to sharpen improv skills and introduce improv to the public, ATA/WhoseWisdom? is to sharpen philosophical analysis, argumentation, and rhetorical skills, and also display them. Similar to "Around The Horn" in that a topic of interest is discussed from different angles, showing different perspectives.

### Rules

1. 3+ players
2. Randomly chosen player is designated "Moderator".
3. Other players are then "Contestants/ Debators".
4. Contestants rank their choice of "Categories".
5. Moderator selects a Category from the given by the Contestants and picks a "Thought Experiment" in that Category.
6. The Thought Experiment is read aloud, and shown if it has images, to all participants.
7. Players are given a short amount of time to gather their thoughts, do research. Moderator may consult the Thought Experiment in the *Manual* to see professional analysis.
8. Winning contestant from previous debate (or random if none) makes argument about Thought Experiment. Other contestants make counter-points or their own arguments. Everyone gets a chance to speak and respond.
9. Moderator awards points to Contestants based on quality of their arguments.
10. Moderator calls end to debate after the discussion finishes or designated time has passed.
11. New Moderator is chosen from one of the contestants and gameplay repeats.
12. Round is over when everyone has been a Moderator.
13. Play as many rounds as desired.
14. Talley scores, determine "winner".

Alternatively, one person can be designated the permanent Moderator. For instance, a teacher or adult can moderate the kid contestants. __Try__ to be fair.

The winner can simply feel good about themselves, or alternatively be given a silly honor, as in Whose Line?, or pontification time, as in ATH.
